node-red-contrib-rfxcom
========================

A collection of <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> nodes to send and receive home automation
commands and data using an [RFXCOM RFXtrx433E](http://www.rfxcom.com/epages/78165469.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/78165469/Products/14103)
home automation controller. Also compatible with the older RFXtrx433 transceivers.

Install
-------

Use npm to install this package locally in the Node-RED data directory (by default, `$HOME/.node-red`):

	cd $HOME/.node-red
	npm install node-red-contrib-rfxcom

Alternatively, it can be installed globally:

    npm install -g node-red-contrib-rfxcom

The nodes will be added to the palette the next time node-RED is started, under the 'home automation' category.

Nodes included in the package
-----------------------------

**rfx-lights-in** Receives messages from 'lighting' type devices such as remote controls, PIR sensors used as light
switches, and some types of doorbell.

**rfx-lights-out** Sends messages to 'lighting' type devices including switches, dimmers, and some types of relay.

**rfx-doorbell-in** Receives messages from wireless bell pushes

**rfx-doorbell-out** Sends messages to wireless door chimes

**rfx-sensor** Receives messages from temperature, humidity, pressure and other weather sensors. Also handles soil
moisture sensors and the maverick ET-732 BBQ thermometer.

**rfx-meter** Receives messages from wireless energy monitors such as OWL

**rfx-detector** Receives messages from wireless intruder and smoke detectors.
**This node and the associated software must not be used in situations where the avoidance of damage to 
or loss of property, or protection from risk of injury or death, may depend on its correct operation.**

**rfx-PT2262-in** Receives messages from devices using the PT2262 chipset. Many no-name remote controls and alarm
systems use these chips

**rfx-PT2262-out** Sends messages to devices using the PT2262 family of chips.

Basic help text is provided for each node. Additional information is available in the 'RFXmngr.exe' program supplied
with the RFXtrx433E, and more details may be found in the SDK documentation, available on request from RFXCOM.

Example flow
------------

The following Node-RED flow listens to an Oregon temperature sensor, and turns a HomeEasy relay on if the temperature is
9.5 degrees or less, off otherwise:
